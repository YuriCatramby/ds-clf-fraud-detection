# Machine Learning for Fraud Detection

Fraud detection is a critical issue in various industries, from financial services to e-commerce and healthcare. Fraud detection refers to the process of identifying and preventing fraudulent activities, such as fraudulent transactions, fake accounts, or identity theft.


Fraud detection is important for businesses because fraud can have serious financial and reputational consequences. Costs associated with fraud include revenue loss, recovery costs, fines and penalties, as well as damage to brand reputation and loss of customer trust.


The data science team has been called to help solve this problem by creating a system to classify transactions as fraudulent or not at the time of purchase, thus avoiding customer relationship issues and financial losses.
